This is an overview of how the Structure page works 
 



On structureComponents page
Numerical input for the number of layers 
- v-model on "num" 
- onBuildStruct puts "num" in a for loop 
    - for ...
        create (random) 3x3 epsilon, mu, and scalar length 
        temporarily put this in layerDataArray 


THEN we go through buildStruct (emws.ts file) 

we then throw the data from layerDataArray into this state object  

now we have "dynamicStructure" in state, this is where our problems really start 

We want there to be a dynamic structure like "dynamicStructure" in this file so that the code can watch it

For right now, all of the calculations are being done with this state.dynamicStructure object
